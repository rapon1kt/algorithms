## Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository will contain C and TypeScript examples of many popular algorithms and data structure.

Each algorithm will have its own readme with the explanation of space and time complexity.

### Data Structures

A data structure is a specific way to store and manage data, can be creating, modifing, updating or delete.

Describing with better words, data structure is a study between the total set\* and the interaction between the elements of that set itself.

In each explanation of exercises, will contain why is better to use certain data structure to solve the problem.

> NOTE: the set here is not linked to the type of structure used in C, but rather a synonym for collection.

### Algorithms

An algorithm is a clearly specified set of simple instructions to be followed to solve a problem.

In this repository, there will be discussions about:

- How to estimate the time required for a program;
- How to reduce the time to fractions of seconds;

### References

The references used in this repository are based on the principles taught at the college I attend and on the videos i watched online. Furthermore, I am using as a bibliographic basis the book **Data Structure and Algorithms Analysis in C**, written by **Mark Allen Weiss**, which I strongly recommend to everyone who is starting out in programming.
